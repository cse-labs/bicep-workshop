# Challenge 3: Integration with Pipelines

In this challenge we'll do the intergration of Bicep template with the Pipelines to provision the infrastructure.

## Challenge

"ChocoFaco" leadership is happy with the progress we have made so far in this space. They are looking for ways where someone should be able to provision the resources by a click of button.


You are requested to integrate the Bicep templates either with Azure DevOps pipelines or Github Actions so that the infra can be deployed using the pipelines.

Once the pipeline or workflow is created, provision the infrastructure using the pipeline.
