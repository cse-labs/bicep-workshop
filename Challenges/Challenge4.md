# Challenge 4: Integration with Pipelines

In this challenge, we'll do the integration of the Bicep template with the Pipelines to provision the infrastructure.

## Challenge

The "ChocoFaco" leadership is happy with the progress we have made so far in this space. They are looking for ways where someone should be able to provide the resources to the team with a click of a button.


You are requested to integrate the Bicep templates either with Azure DevOps pipelines or Github Actions so that the infra can be deployed using the pipelines.

Once the pipeline or workflow is created, provision the infrastructure using the pipeline.
